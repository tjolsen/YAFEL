Computational Inelasticity
==========================

This is a project to implement some of the ideas in the book
Computational Inelasticity by Simo and Hughes. By and large,
I will restrict myself to using (relatively low-order, p=1 or 2)
continuous-Galerkin FEM, unless something else is specifically 
called for.

The goals of this project are similar to (and will occur in
parallel with) the "Computational Methods for Plasticity" project.
Hopefully, through the completion of this process, I'll have a
reasonably functional FEM application, complete with expressive
input/config language (lua?). Configuration from this work may
make its way upstream into the main library, if it proves general
enough to belong there.
